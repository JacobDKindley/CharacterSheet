# CharacterSheet
# Description
Allows multiple users to connect to a virtual battle map with drawing and token functionality to assist playing D&D online. The program also acts as a character sheet to help keep track of inventory, spells, abilities, bonuses, and I think everything you'd need to reference while playing. Also has dice rollers that automatically apply corresponding bonus to help with math.
# Usage
You don't need to download the src folder, that has all the code and you don't have to worry about it.

Download the jar file and put it wherever you want.
Unzip Files.zip in the same location you put the jar file.
For example, if the jar file is located at ...\Users\Stuff\CharacterSheet.jar then you should have the Files folder at ...\Users\Stuff\Files.
